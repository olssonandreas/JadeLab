JadeLab
=======

Multi agent system lab.

Three questions about wines are asked from an agent and another agent answers.

The program collects different properties from wines with SPARQL and OWL Wine ontology.
The Wine information is later made into PROLOG predicates for the agents to reason about.
The response agent answers in XML format back to the agent who asked the question.

The agent asks the agent in this form "wine(Output,_,_,_,_,dry,_)"
Where output is the answer you want, and the other are inputs for wine properties. 


Science!
